                <h2>What is DreadLore?</h2>
                <p>
                    DreadLore is a narrative table-top RPG, built around an original Fantasy Punk setting. If you enjoy taking a real role in the creative process of story-telling, and you also wanna roll some dice and kill bad (or good) guys&#8230;chances are this is the system for you.
                </p>

                <div class="divider"></div>
                <h2>What is a "System"?</h2>
                <p>
                    Ever heard of a table-top RPG? e.g. Dungeons &amp; Dragons, World of Darkness, Numenera, etc.? DreadLoreâ„¢ is a similar sort of board game. These games are classified in several ways: table-top, pen &amp; ink, RPG and silly dice games <-- my favorite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most systems are comprised of just a few factors. There is usually a Setting (sci-fi, fantasy, etc.) and a list of Core Mechanics (how the numbers &amp; math work in the game). Table-top systems also require a Game Master in addition to several Players to play.
                </p>

                <h2>Goals of DreadLore</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Narrative storytelling with some tasteful crunch.
                        Players and the Arbiter are more focused on storytelling and character decisions and less focused on hyper-complex character building and dice rolling for the biggest numbers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Social and physical combat are effective, efficient, and fun.
                        Fluidity and symmetry of play so as to avoid clunky number crunching and lengthy (real time) combats.
                    </li>
                    <li>Keep rules light while still allowing for and rewarding tactical and strategic gameplay.
                    </li>
                    <li>A system of mechanics that feels free enough that players have the ability to make viable characters of any type, while not so open-ended as to feel ill-defined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Include an accompanying character sheet that encourages roleplay and characterization
                    </li>
                </ol>
