        <p>Ever heard of a table-top RPG? e.g. Dungeons &amp; Dragons, World of Darkness, Numenera, etc.? DreadLoreâ„¢ is a similar sort of board game. These games are classified in several ways: table-top, pen &amp; ink, RPG and silly dice games - my favorite.</p>
        <p>Most systems are comprised of just a few factors. There is usually a Setting (sci-fi, fantasy, etc.) and a list of Core Mechanics (how the numbers &amp; math work in the game). Table-top systems also require a Game Master in addition to several Players to play.</p>
