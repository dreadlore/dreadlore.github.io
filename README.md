# DreadLore System Official Site
+ DreadLore is a tabletop RPG which the co-founder of Adventure Kings LLC and myself are creating; the game can be thought of as a 'pen & ink' RPG similar to Dungeons & Dragons, Numenera, etc.
+ I am building this static website to bolster my web development skills as well as to create a much-needed 'official' website for our business venture.

## Materialize CSS
+ The obligatory site built using Materialize CSS. As my main focus (and career) is web development, I decided to learn and showcase my growing skills using Materialize CSS. I chose Materialize CSS over Material-Design-Lite in accordance with some advice I received from a fellow 'bootcamp' cohort.

## Responsive
+ A major goal is for this site to be 'very' viewable on mobile. That's about all I've got right now.

## Functional
+ Although I abore useless 'bells and whistles', it seems the masses love'em. I plan on employing some of Material CSS' more interesting UX effects. As always, I must leave out elements which serve no purpose; I just can't help myself!
