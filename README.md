# DreadLore System Official Site
+ [DreadLore] 'DL' is a tabletop RPG which the co-founder of Adventure Kings LLC and myself are creating; the game can be thought of as a 'pen & ink' RPG similar to [Dungeons & Dragons], [Numenera], etc.
+ I am building this static website to bolster my web development skills as well as to create a much-needed 'official' website for our business venture.

## Versions
+ As I learned in the 'bootcamp', it's more important to have a working, unfinished (even ugly) product than to have no product at all. Thus, for the time being, I'll be deploying a simple site which uses [Materialze] instead of Bootstrap - I might as well test out something new. In the meantime, I'm working on a [Flask] tutorial on the side; the eventual DL site will most likely be built off Flask.

## [Materialize] CSS
+ The obligatory site built using [Materialize] CSS. As my main focus (and career) is web development, I decided to learn and showcase my growing skills using Materialize CSS. I chose Materialize CSS over [Material-Design-Lite] in accordance with some advice I received from a fellow 'bootcamp' cohort - in short, MDL is a little less intuitive than Materialize; that's probably because Materialize seems much similar to how __bootstrap__ works.

## Responsive
+ A major goal is for this site to be 'very' viewable on mobile. That's about all I've got right now.

## Functional
+ Although I abore useless 'bells and whistles', it seems the masses love'em. I plan on employing some of Material CSS' more interesting UX effects. As always, I must leave out elements which serve no purpose; I just can't help myself!
