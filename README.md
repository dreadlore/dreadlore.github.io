# DreadLore System Official Site
+ [**DreadLore**][official] is a tabletop role-playing game with its own original setting, Craster. The DreadLore system can be used to run many other settings, e.g. steam punk, near future, fantasy, horror, etc. This is the official site for the game. 
+ Our Kickstarter campaign to create and publish an official DreadLore Core Book was successful! As such, I will be making this site more robust, and in the future, plan to add a Character Creator app to it.

## Versions
1. I've leveraged **ChatGPT** to help me further improve this site with a carousel. It's simple _Javascript_, but I enjoy how clinical ChatGPT codes it. I had to correct a few minior errors in the code, of course, but I think it looks great!
1. As I learned in the 'bootcamp', it's more important to have a working, unfinished (even ugly) product than to have no product at all. Thus, for the time being, I'll be deploying a simple site which uses [Materialze] instead of Bootstrap - I might as well test out something new. In the meantime, I'm working on a [Flask] tutorial on the side; the eventual DL site will most likely be built off Flask.

## Materialize CSS
+ The obligatory site built using [**Materialize CSS**][MaterialzeCSS]. As my main focus (and career) is web development, I decided to learn and showcase my growing skills using Materialize CSS. I chose Materialize CSS over [Material Design Lite][Material-Design-Lite] in accordance with some advice I received from a fellow 'bootcamp' cohort - in short, MDL is a little less intuitive than Materialize; that's probably because Materialize seems much similar to how **bootstrap** works.

## Responsive
+ A major goal is for this site to be 'very' viewable on mobile. That's about all I've got right now.

## Functional
+ Although I abore useless 'bells and whistles', it seems the masses love'em. I plan on employing some of Material CSS' more interesting UX effects. As always, I must leave out elements which serve no purpose; I just can't help myself!
